# Crypto_portfolio_managment_systems
this is a raider system which should be use with my trading system tho, it's still got some bias. but will be fixed later

# How to use it?
 just run main.py
 then it will pop-up a question asking you how much assets you would like to put in the crypto market.
  The system will automatically calculate the daily returns for top 20 currency in the market, but the data are not the most recent data. 
  THUS THIS SYSTEM ARE NOT FOR PRATICAL USSAGE, ANY LOST OR DAMMAGE WILL NOT RESPONSIBLE BY THE EDITORã€‚
